      "Answer:  Cinderella reached her happy ending by persevering through her hardships and remaining kind-hearted despite the mistreatment from her stepmother and stepsisters. With the help of a magical bird and a hazel tree, Cinderella was able to obtain beautiful dresses and attend the royal festival where the prince fell in love with her. Even though she had to flee from the prince a few times, he eventually found her and recognized her as the true bride. The prince then took Cinderella by the hand and they lived happily ever after. Ultimately, Cinderella's kindness, resilience, and unwavering hope led her to her happy ending of finding true love and a happily ever after with the prince.\n"
